# Change Requests

Question: What new change requests to the source code occurred during a certain period?

## Description
When a project uses change request processes, changes are not directly
submitted to the code base, but are first proposed for discussion
as "proposals for change to the source code".
Each of these change requests are intended to be reviewed by other developers,
who may suggest improvements that will lead to the original proposers
sending new versions of their change requests, until reviews are
positive, and the code is accepted, or until it is decided that
the proposal is declined.

For example, "change requests" correspond to "pull requests" in the case of GitHub,
to "merge requests" in the case of GitLab, and to "code reviews"
or in some contexts "changesets" in the case of Gerrit.


## Objectives
* Volume of changes proposed to a project.
    Change requests are a dimension for the activity in a project.
    By counting change requests in the set of repositories corresponding
    to a project, you can have an idea of the overall activity in
    changes to that project.
    Of course, this metric is not the only one that should be
    used to track volume of coding activity.


## Implementation

**Aggregators:**
* Count. Total number of change requests during the period.

**Parameters:**

* Period of time. Start and finish date of the period. Default: forever.  
    Period during which change requests are considered.

* Criteria for source code. Algorithm. Default: all files are source code.  
    If we are focused on source code, we need a criteria for deciding
    whether a file is a part of the source code or not.


### Filters

* By actors (submitter, reviewer, merger). Requires actor merging
(merging ids corresponding to the same author).
* By groups of actors (employer, gender... for each of the actors).
Requires actor grouping, and likely, actor merging.
* Status (open, closed)


### Visualizations

* Count per month over time
* Count per group over time

These could be represented as bar charts, with time running in the X axis.
Each bar would represent change requests to change the code
during a certain period (eg, a month).



### Tools Providing the Metric

* [Grimoirelab](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab) provides this metric out of the box for GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests, and Gerrit Changesets.  
  - View an example on the [CHAOSS instance of Bitergia Analytics](https://chaoss.biterg.io/app/kibana#/dashboard/GitHub-Pull-Requests).  
  - Download and import a ready-to-go dashboard containing examples for this metric visualization based on GitHub Pull Requests data from the [GrimoireLab Sigils panel collection](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/panels/github-pullrequests/).

### Data Collection Strategies

**Specific description: GitHub**

In the case of GitHub, a change request is defined as a "pull request",
as long as it proposes changes to source code files.

The date of the review can be defined (for considering it in a period or not)
as the date in which the pull request was submitted.

**Specific description: GitLab**

In the case of GitLab, a change request is defined as a "merge request",
as long as it proposes changes to source code files.

The date of the change request can be defined (for considering it in a period or not)
as the date in which the change request was submitted.

**Specific description: Gerrit**

In the case of Gerrit, a change request is defined as a "code review",
or in some contexts, a "changeset",
as long as it proposes changes to source code files.

The date of the change request can be defined (for considering it in a period or not)
as the date in which the change request was started by submitting a
patchset for review.
